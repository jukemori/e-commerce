## Sanity Schema

Our Sanity schema includes the following content types:

   - Fields: name, images, description, slug, price, price_id (Stripe), category

2. **Category**: Used to categorize products.

   - Fields: name

3. **HeroImages**: Stores two hero images for the homepage.
   - Fields: image1, image2

To modify the schema, edit the files in the `sanity/schemaTypes` directory.

We use Stripe for payment processing. The Stripe public key is configured in the `.env.local` file.

To interact with Stripe, use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY` environment variable in your client-side code.
